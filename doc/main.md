# Information

This library is part of the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) (HDX) project. If you have 
humanitarian related data, please upload your datasets to HDX.

The code for the library is [here](https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/hdx-python-utilities).
The library has detailed API documentation which can be found in the menu at the top. 

## Breaking Changes
From 3.5.5, Python 3.7 no longer supported

From 3.3.7, improved parse_date and parse_date_range by default will attempt to parse 
time zone if date format not given. The default time zone is UTC (not no timezone). 

From 3.1.5, changed setup_logging parameters to console_log_level, log_file and 
file_log_level.

From 3.1.1, setup_logging now sets up logaru instead of colorlog and has only one 
parameter error_file which is False by default. There is no longer SMTP (email) handling
which can be done directly with logaru instead.

From 3.0.7, send method of Email class has parameter to rather than recipients. The parameters to, cc and bcc
take either a string email address or list of string email addresses.

From 3.0.3, build stack has changed. Now uses tox, codecov etc. setup.py clean, package and publish removed.
is_valid_uuid and get_uuid are now under hdx.utilities.uuid.

From 3.0.1, removed raisefrom function

From 3.0.0, only supports Python >= 3.6

From 2.6.9, the Download class and get_session have optional allowed_methods instead of optional method_whitelist

From 2.5.5, the Database class and all the libraries on which it depended have been moved to the new 
[HDX Python Database library](https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/hdx-python-database).

From 2.1.2, get_tabular_rows in the Download class returns headers, iterator and a new method get_tabular_rows_as_list 
returns only the iterator.

From 2.1.4, read_list_from_csv and write_list_to_csv change the order of their parameters to be more logical.
Arguments about choosing between dict and list are all made consistent - dict_form.

# Description of Utilities

## Downloading files

Various utilities to help with downloading files. Includes retrying by default.
The `Download` class inherits from `BaseDownload` which specifies a number of standard
methods that all downloaders should have: `download_file`, `download_text`, 
`download_yaml`, `download_json` and `get_tabular_rows`. 

- `download_file` returns a path to a file
- `download_text` returns the text in a file
- `download_json` returns the JSON in a Python dictionary
- `download_yaml` returns the YAML in a Python dictionary
- `get_tabular_rows` returns headers and an iterator (through rows)

Note that a single `Download` object cannot be used in parallel: each download operation 
must be completed before starting the next. 

For example, given YAML file extraparams.yml:

    mykey:
        basic_auth: "XXXXXXXX"
        locale: "en"

We can create a downloader as shown below that will use the authentication defined in 
`basic\_auth` and add the parameter `locale=en` to each request (eg. for get request 
<http://myurl/lala?param1=p1&locale=en>):

    with Download(user_agent="test", extra_params_yaml="extraparams.yml", extra_params_lookup="mykey") as downloader:
        response = downloader.download(url)  # get requests library response
        json = response.json()

        # Download file to folder/filename
        f = downloader.download_file("http://myurl", post=False,
                                     parameters=OrderedDict([("b", "4"), ("d", "3")]),
                                     folder=tmpdir, filename=filename)
        filepath = abspath(f)

        # Read row by row from tabular file
        headers, iterator = downloader.get_tabular_rows("http://myurl/my.csv", dict_rows=True, headers=1) 
        for row in iterator:
            a = row["col"]

You will get an error if you try to call `get_tabular_rows` twice with different urls to 
get two iterators, then afterwards iterate through those iterators. The first iteration
must be completed before obtaining another iterator.

If we want to limit the rate of get and post requests to say 1 per 0.1 seconds, then the 
`rate_limit` parameter can be passed:

    with Download(rate_limit={"calls": 1, "period": 0.1}) as downloader:
        response = downloader.download(url)  # get requests library response

If we want a user agent that will be used in all relevant HDX Python Utilities methods 
(and all HDX Python API ones too if that library is included), then it can be configured 
once and used automatically:

    UserAgent.set_global("test")
    with Download() as downloader:
        response = downloader.download(url)  # get requests library response

The response is of the form produced by the requests library. It may not be needed as 
there are functions directly on the Download object eg.

    assert downloader.get_status() == 200
    assert len(downloader.get_headers()) == 24
    assert bool(re.match(r"7\d\d", downloader.get_header("Content-Length"))) is True
    assert downloader.get_text() == "XXX"
    assert downloader.get_json() == {...}
    assert downloader.get_yaml() == {...}

The `get_tabular_rows` method enables iteration through tabular data. It returns the 
header of tabular file pointed to by the url and an iterator where each row is returned 
as a list or dictionary depending on the dict_rows argument.

The headers argument is either a row number or list of row numbers (in case of 
multi-line headers) to be considered as headers (rows start counting at 1), or the 
actual headers defined a list of strings. It defaults to 1 and cannot be None. 
The `dict_form` arguments specifies if each row should be returned as a dictionary or a 
list, defaulting to a list.  

Optionally, headers can be inserted at specific positions. This is achieved using the 
header_insertions argument. If supplied, it is a list of tuples of the form 
`(position, header)` to be inserted. Optionally a function can be called on each row. 
If supplied, it takes as arguments: headers (prior to any insertions) and row (which 
will be in dict or list form depending upon the dict_rows argument) and outputs a 
modified row. Example:

    def testfn(headers, row):
        row["la"] = "lala"
        return row

    insertions = {"headers": [(2, "la")], "function": testfn}
    headers, generator = downloader.get_tabular_rows(url, headers=3, 
                                                     header_insertions=[(2, "la")], row_function=testfn)

Other useful functions:

    # Iterate through tabular file returning lists for each row
    headers, iterator = downloader.get_tabular_rows_as_list(url) 
    for row in iterator:
        ...
    # Get hxl row
    assert Download.hxl_row(["a", "b", "c"], {"b": "#b", "c": "#c"}, dict_form=True)
    # == {"a": "", "b": "#b", "c": "#c"}        
    # Build get url from url and dictionary of parameters
    Download.get_url_for_get("http://www.lala.com/hdfa?a=3&b=4",
                             OrderedDict([("c", "e"), ("d", "f")]))
    # == "http://www.lala.com/hdfa?a=3&b=4&c=e&d=f"

    # Extract url and dictionary of parameters from get url
    Download.get_url_params_for_post("http://www.lala.com/hdfa?a=3&b=4",
                                     OrderedDict([("c", "e"), ("d", "f")]))
    # == ("http://www.lala.com/hdfa",
              OrderedDict([("a", "3"), ("b", "4"), ("c", "e"), ("d", "f")]))
    # Get mapping of columns positions of headers          
    Download.get_column_positions(["a", "b", "c"])
    # == {"a": 0, "b": 1, "c": 2}

    # Get unique filename from url and join to provided folder or temporary folder 
    # if no folder supplied
    # path = Download.get_path_for_url(url, folder)

For more detail and additional functions, check the API docs mentioned earlier in the 
[usage section](#usage).

## Retrieving files

The `Retrieve` class inherits from `BaseDownload` which specifies a number of standard
methods that all downloaders should have: `download_file`, `download_text`, 
`download_yaml`, `download_json` and `get_tabular_rows`. 

Note that a single `Retrieve` object cannot be used in parallel: each download operation 
must be completed before starting the next. For example, you will get an error if you 
try to call `get_tabular_rows` twice with different urls to get two iterators, then 
afterwards iterate through those iterators. The first iteration must be completed before 
obtaining another iterator.


When you download a file, you can opt to download from the web as usual or download from 
the web and and save for future reuse or use the previously downloaded file. The 
advantage is this is all handled in the class so you don't need to do lots of if-else 
conditions for the different cases for each download in your code. This is helpful for 
example when trying to generate test data. 

All the downloads in your code can be switched between the different modes by setting 
the save and use_saved flags when 
constructing the Retrieve object.

    retriever = Retrieve(downloader, fallback_dir, saved_dir, temp_dir, save, use_saved)

- `save=False, use_saved=False`  - download from web as normal (files will go in 
temp_folder and be discarded)
- `save=True, use_saved=False` - download from web as normal (files will go in saved_dir 
and will be kept)
- `save=False, use_saved=True` - use files from saved_dir (don't download at all)

fallback_dir is a folder containing static fallback files which can optionally be used 
if the download fails.

Examples:

    with Download() as downloader:
        # Downloads file returning the path to the downloaded file and using a fallback file if the download 
        # fails. Since saved is False, the file will be saved with name filename in temp_dir
        retriever = Retrieve(downloader, fallback_dir, saved_dir, temp_dir, save=False, use_saved=False, log_level=logging.DEBUG) 
        path = retriever.download_file(url, filename, logstr="my file", fallback=True)

        # Downloads text file saving it for future usage and returning the text data (with no fallback) 
        # Since saved is True, the file will be saved with name filename in saved_dir
        retriever = Retrieve(downloader, fallback_dir, saved_dir, temp_dir, save=True, use_saved=False)
        text = retriever.download_text(url, filename, logstr="test text", fallback=False)
        # Downloads YAML file saving it for future usage and returning the YAML data with fallback taken
        # from fallback_dir if needed.
        data = retriever.download_yaml(url, filename, logstr="test yaml", fallback=True)

        # Uses previously downloaded JSON file in saved_dir returning the JSON data (with no fallback) 
        retriever = Retrieve(downloader, fallback_dir, saved_dir, temp_dir, save=False, use_saved=True)
        data = retriever.download_json(url, filename, logstr="test json", fallback=False, log_level=logging.DEBUG)

## Date utilities

There are utilities to parse dates. By default, *no timezone information will be parsed 
and the returned datetime will have timezone set to UTC*. To change this behaviour, the 
functions have a parameter `timezone_handling` which should be changed from its default 
of 0. If it is 1, then no timezone information will be parsed and a naive datetime will 
be returned. If it is 2 or more, then timezone information will be parsed. For 2, 
failure to parse timezone will result in a naive datetime. For 3, failure to parse 
timezone will result in the timezone being set to UTC. For 4 and 5, the time will be 
converted from whatever timezone is identified to UTC. For 4, failure to parse timezone 
will result in a naive (local) datetime converted to UTC. For 5, failure to parse 
timezone will result in the timezone being set to UTC.

Ambiguous dates are parsed as day first D/M/Y where there are values in front of the 
year and day last Y/M/D where there are values after the year.

Examples:

    # Standard dates
    now_in_utc = now_utc()
    date = default_date  # a very early date for avoiding date comparison with None
    date = default_date_notz  # as above with no timezone info
    date = default_end_date  # a very late date for avoiding date comparison with None
    date = default_end_date_notz  # as above with no timezone info
    
    # Parse dates
    assert parse_date("20/02/2013") == datetime(2013, 2, 20, 0, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    assert parse_date("20/02/2013", "%d/%m/%Y") == datetime(2013, 2, 20, 0, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)

    assert fuzzy == {"startdate": datetime(2013, 2, 20, 0, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc), 
                     "enddate": datetime(2013, 2, 20, 0, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc),

    # Convert between datetime and timestamp
    expected_timestamp = 1596180834.0
    expected_date = datetime(2020, 7, 31, 7, 33, 54, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    timestamp = get_timestamp_from_datetime(expected_date)
    assert timestamp == expected_timestamp
    date = get_datetime_from_timestamp(
        expected_timestamp, timezone=timezone.utc
    )
    assert date == expected_date
    date = get_datetime_from_timestamp(
        expected_timestamp * 1000, timezone=timezone.utc
    )
    assert date == expected_date

## Loading and saving JSON and YAML

Examples:

    # Load YAML
    mydict = load_yaml("my_yaml.yml")

    # Load 2 YAMLs and merge into dictionary
    mydict = load_and_merge_yaml("my_yaml1.yml", "my_yaml2.yml")

    # Load YAML into existing dictionary
    mydict = load_yaml_into_existing_dict(existing_dict, "my_yaml.yml")

    # Load JSON
    mydict = load_json("my_json.yml")

    # Load 2 JSONs and merge into dictionary
    mydict = load_and_merge_json("my_json1.json", "my_json2.json")

    # Load JSON into existing dictionary
    mydict = load_json_into_existing_dict(existing_dict, "my_json.json")

    # Save dictionary to YAML file in pretty format
    # preserving order if it is an OrderedDict
    save_yaml(mydict, "mypath.yml", pretty=True, sortkeys=False)

    # Save dictionary to JSON file in compact form
    # sorting the keys
    save_json(mydict, "mypath.json", pretty=False, sortkeys=False)

## Loading and saving HXLated csv and/or JSON

`save_hxlated_output` is a utility to save HXLated output (currently JSON and/or csv are
supported) based on a given configuration. Here is an example YAML configuration:

    input:
      headers:
        - "Col1"
        - "Col2"
        - "Col3"
      hxltags:
        - "#tag1"
        - "#tag2"
        - "#tag3"
    process:
      - header: "tag4"
        hxltag: "#tag4"
        expression: "#tag1 * 10"
    output:
      csv:
        filename: "out.csv"
        hxltags:
          - "#tag2"
          - "#tag3"
      json:
        filename: "out.json"
        data: "results"
        metadata:
          "#date": "{{today}}"
          "#mytag": 123
        hxltags:
          - "#tag1"
          - "#tag2"

The `input` section is needed if the rows of data that are passed in are missing either
headers or HXL hashtags. The `output` section defines what files will be created. If
`hxltags` are specified, then only those columns are output. CSV output would look like 
this:

    Col2,Col3,tag4
    #tag2,#tag3,#tag4
    2,3,10
    5,6,40


For JSON output, if no `metadata` or `data` is specified, the output will look like 
this:

    [
    {"#tag1":1,"#tag2":"2","#tag4":10},
    {"#tag1":4,"#tag2":"5","#tag4":40}
    ]

If only `metadata` was specified, not `data`, then output is like this:

    {"metadata":{"#date":"today!","#mytag":123},"data":[
    {"#tag1":1,"#tag2":"2","#tag4":10},
    {"#tag1":4,"#tag2":"5","#tag4":40}
    ]}

Otherwise, the result is like this:

    {"metadata":{"#date":"today!","#mytag":123},"results":[
    {"#tag1":1,"#tag2":"2","#tag4":10},
    {"#tag1":4,"#tag2":"5","#tag4":40}
    ]}

The utility is called as follows:

    save_hxlated_output(
        configuration,
        rows,
        includes_header=True,
        includes_hxltags=True,
        output_dir=output_dir,
        today="today!",
    )

The first parameter is the configuration which can come from a YAML file for example.
The second parameter, `rows` is the data. That data can be a list of lists, tuples or 
dictionaries. If `includes_header` is `True`, headers are taken from `rows`, otherwise
they must be given by the configuration. If `includes_hxltags` is `True`, HXL hashtags 
are taken from `rows`, otherwise they must be given by the configuration. `output_dir`
specifies where the output should go and defaults to "". Any other parameters (such as
`today` in the example above) are used to populate template variables given in the
configuration for the metadata.

## Dictionary and list utilities

Examples:

    # Merge dictionaries
    d1 = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: ["a", "b", "c"]}
    d2 = {2: 6, 5: 8, 6: 9, 4: ["d", "e"]}
    result = merge_dictionaries([d1, d2])
    assert result == {1: 1, 2: 6, 3: 3, 4: ["d", "e"], 5: 8, 6: 9}

    # Diff dictionaries
    d1 = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: {"a": 1, "b": "c"}}
    d2 = {4: {"a": 1, "b": "c"}, 2: 2, 3: 3, 1: 1}
    diff = dict_diff(d1, d2)

## HTML utilities

These are built on top of BeautifulSoup and simplify its setup.

Examples:

    # Get soup for url with optional kwarg downloader=Download() object
    soup = get_soup("http://myurl", user_agent="test")
    # user agent can be set globally using:
    # UserAgent.set_global("test")
    tag = soup.find(id="mytag")

    # Get text of tag stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
    # and newlines and with &nbsp replaced with space
    result = get_text("mytag")

    # Extract HTML table as list of dictionaries
    result = extract_table(tabletag)

## Comparing files

Compare two files:

    result = compare_files(testfile1, testfile2)
    # Result is of form eg.:
    # ["- coal   ,3      ,7.4    ,'needed'\n",
    #  "?         ^\n",
    #  "+ coal   ,1      ,7.4    ,'notneeded'\n",
    #  "?         ^                +++\n"]

## Emailing

Example of setup and sending email:

    smtp_initargs = {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 123,
        "local_hostname": "mycomputer.fqdn.com",
        "timeout": 3,
        "source_address": ("machine", 456),
    }
    username = "user@user.com"
    password = "pass"
    email_config_dict = {
        "connection_type": "ssl",
        "username": username,
        "password": password
    }
    email_config_dict.update(smtp_initargs)

    recipients = ["larry@gmail.com", "moe@gmail.com", "curly@gmail.com"]
    subject = "hello"
    text_body = "hello there"
    html_body = """\
    <html>
      <head></head>
      <body>
        <p>Hi!<br>
           How are you?<br>
           Here is the <a href="https://www.python.org">link</a> you wanted.
        </p>
      </body>
    </html>
    """
    sender = "me@gmail.com"

    with Email(email_config_dict=email_config_dict) as email:
        email.send(recipients, subject, text_body, sender=sender)

## Logging

The library provides elegant logs to the console with a simple default setup which 
should be adequate for most cases. By default, the log shows `INFO` level and higher. 
This can be changed with `console_log_level`. If `log_file`, a path to a log file, is 
specified then logging will also go to a file. The log level for the file can be
set using `file_log_level` which by default is `ERROR`.

    from hdx.utilities.easy_logging import setup_logging
    ...
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    setup_logging(console_log_level="DEBUG", log_file="output.log", 
    file_log_level="INFO")

To use logging in your files, simply add the line below to the top of
each Python file:

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Then use the logger like this:

    logger.debug("DEBUG message")
    logger.info("INFORMATION message")
    logger.warning("WARNING message")
    logger.error("ERROR message")
    logger.critical("CRITICAL error message")

There is a class that allows collecting of errors to be logged later, typically on exit.
It is called ErrorsOnExit and can be used as follows:

    with ErrorsOnExit() as errors:
        ...
        errors.add("MY ERROR MESSAGE")
        ...
        errors.add("ANOTHER ERROR MESSAGE")

The above code will collect the errors, in this case "MY ERROR MESSAGE" and "ANOTHER 
ERROR MESSAGE". On leaving the `with` block, the errors will be logged and the code will
exit with the error code 1 (ie. `sys.exit(1)` will be called). If there are no errors, 
the code will not exit and execution will continue after the `with` block (ie.
`sys.exit(1)` will not be called).

## State utility

The State class allows the reading and writing of state to a given path. Input 
and output state transformations can be supplied in read_fn and write_fn 
respectively. The input state transformation takes in a string while the output 
transformation outputs a string. It is used as follows: 

        with temp_dir(folder="test_state") as tmpdir:
            statepath = join(tmpdir, statefile)
            copyfile(join(statefolder, statefile), statepath)
            date1 = datetime(2020, 9, 23, 0, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
            date2 = datetime(2022, 5, 12, 10, 15, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
            with State(
                statepath, parse_date, iso_string_from_datetime
            ) as state:
                assert state.get() == date1
                state.set(date2)
            with State(
                statepath, parse_date, iso_string_from_datetime
            ) as state:
                assert state.get() == date2.replace(hour=0, minute=0)

If run inside a GitHub Action, the saved state file could be committed to 
GitHub so that on the next run the state is available in the repository.

## Path utilities

Examples:

Get current directory of script

    dir = script_dir(ANY_PYTHON_OBJECT_IN_SCRIPT)

Get current directory of script with filename appended

    path = script_dir_plus_file("myfile.txt", ANY_PYTHON_OBJECT_IN_SCRIPT)

Get filename or (filename, extension) from url

    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCHA-DAP/hdx-python-utilities/master/tests/fixtures/test_data.csv"
    filename = get_filename_from_url(fixtureurl)
    assert filename == "test_data.csv"
    filename, extension = get_filename_extension_from_url(fixtureurl)
    assert filename == "test_data"
    assert extension == ".csv"

Gets temporary directory from environment variable `TEMP_DIR` and falls back to 
the temporary folder created by the os function `gettempdir`.
    
    temp_folder = get_temp_dir()

Gets temporary directory from environment variable `TEMP_DIR` and falls back to 
the temporary folder created by the os function `gettempdir`.  It (optionally) 
appends the given folder name, creates the folder and deletes the folder if 
exiting successfully else keeps the folder if there was an exception.

    with temp_dir("papa", delete_on_success=True, delete_on_failure=False) as tempdir:
        ...

Sometimes it is necessary to be able to resume runs if they fail. The following 
example creates a temporary folder and iterates through a list of items. On 
each iteration, the current state of progress is stored in the temporary 
folder. If the iteration were to fail, the temporary folder is not deleted and 
on the next run, it will resume where it failed assuming that the new run does
not recreate the environment (eg. this would work with a dedicated server but 
not GitHub Actions). Once the whole list is iterated through, the temporary 
folder is deleted.

What is returned each iteration is a tuple with 2 dictionaries. The first 
(`info`) contains key `folder` which is the temporary directory optionally with 
folder appended (and created if it doesn't exist). In key `progress` is held 
the current position in the iterator. It also contains the key `batch` 
containing a batch code to be passed as the `batch` parameter in 
`create_in_hdx` or `update_in_hdx` calls. The second dictionary is the next 
dictionary in the iterator. The environment variable `WHERETOSTART` can be set 
to the starting value for example `iso3=SDN` in the example below. If it is set 
to `RESET`, then the temporary folder is deleted before the run starts to 
ensure it starts from the beginning.

    iterator = [{"iso3": "AFG", "name": "Afghanistan"}, {"iso3": "SDN", "name": "Sudan"},
                {"iso3": "YEM", "name": "Yemen"}, {"iso3": "ZAM", "name": "Zambia"}]
    result = list()
    for info, nextdict in progress_storing_tempdir(tempfolder, iterator, "iso3"):
        ...

Sometimes, it may be necessary to create the folder and batch code for use by 
parts of the code outside of the iterator. This can be achieved as follows:

    with wheretostart_tempdir_batch(tempfolder) as info:
        folder = info["folder"]
        ...
        for info, country in progress_storing_folder(info, iterator, "iso3"):
            ...

The batch code can be passed into `wheretostart_tempdir_batch` in the `batch` 
parameter. If not given, the batch code is generated. The folder to use will be 
a generated temporary folder unless `tempdir` is given. 

## Text processing

Examples:

    a = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. It was so fast!"
    
    # Remove whitespace and punctuation from end of string
    assert remove_end_characters('lalala,.,"') == "lalala"
    assert remove_end_characters('lalala, .\t/,"', f"{punctuation}{whitespace}" == "lalala"
    
    # Remove list of items from end of string, stripping any whitespace
    result = remove_from_end(a, ["fast!", "so"], "Transforming %s -> %s")
    assert result == "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. It was"

    # Remove string from another string and delete any preceding end characters - by default 
    # punctuation (eg. comma) and any whitespace following the punctuation
    assert remove_string("lala, 01/02/2020 ", "01/02/2020") == "lala "
    assert remove_string("lala,(01/02/2020) ", "01/02/2020") == "lala) "
    assert remove_string("lala, 01/02/2020 ", "01/02/2020", PUNCTUATION_MINUS_BRACKETS) == "lala "
    assert remove_string("lala,(01/02/2020) ", "01/02/2020", PUNCTUATION_MINUS_BRACKETS) == "lala,() "

    # Replace multiple strings in a string simultaneously
    result = multiple_replace(a, {"quick": "slow", "fast": "slow", "lazy": "busy"})
    assert result == "The slow brown fox jumped over the busy dog. It was so slow!"

    # Extract words from a string sentence into a list
    result = get_words_in_sentence("Korea (Democratic People's Republic of)")
    assert result == ["Korea", "Democratic", "People's", "Republic", "of"]

    # Find matching text in strings
    a = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. It was so fast!"
    b = "The quicker brown fox leapt over the slower fox. It was so fast!"
    c = "The quick brown fox climbed over the lazy dog. It was so fast!"
    result = get_matching_text([a, b, c], match_min_size=10)
    assert result == " brown fox  over the  It was so fast!"

    # Search a string for each of a list of strings and return the earliest index
    assert earliest_index(a, ["dog", "lala", "fox", "haha", "quick"]) == 4

    # Look for template variables in a string (ie. {{XXX}})
    assert match_template_variables("dasdda{{abc}}gff") == ("{{abc}}", "abc")

## Encoding utilities

Examples:

    # Base 64 encode and decode string
    a = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. It was so fast!"
    b = str_to_base64(a)
    c = base64_to_str(b)
    user = "user"
    password = "password"
    a = basicauth_encode(user, password)
    b = basicauth_decode(a)

## Valid UUID

Examples:

    assert is_valid_uuid("jpsmith") is False
    assert is_valid_uuid("c9bf9e57-1685-4c89-bafb-ff5af830be8a") is True

## Easy building and packaging

The pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, .readthedocs.yml and GitHub Actions workflows 
provide a template that can be used by other projects or libraries.
